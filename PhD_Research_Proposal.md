# IoT Security Through Deception: A Novel Approach to Malware Defense
## PhD Research Proposal

### 1. Research Summary
This research proposes a novel approach to IoT security through the implementation of deceptive computing environments. The project, named Cyber Scarecrow, introduces an innovative security framework that manipulates system calls and creates a deceptive environment to neutralize malware threats targeting IoT devices.

### 2. Research Background
